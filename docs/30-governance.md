# Governance

- Ownership model: each transformation has a code owner and review policy.
- Promotion: dev -> staging -> prod via CI gates (tests, quality, performance).
- Documentation: auto-generate API docs; maintain data dictionary and SLA.
- Backward compatibility: version your transforms; avoid breaking changes.
- Risk & compliance: record of processing, data classification, retention policy.
