# Onboarding

1) Fork this template and set project name.
2) Choose connectors to enable and add credentials (Key Vault in prod).
3) Write your first transformation:
   - Create `src/ctl_core/transforms/your_transform.py`
   - Register in `registry.py`
   - Add tests and docs.
4) Run API locally and test with `/docs`.
5) Deploy to your preferred environment and integrate with your tools.
