# Vision and Objectives

- Establish a single, governed, shareable transformation layer (CTL) usable by multiple audiences.
- Reduce duplicated transformations across teams and tools (Excel, Stata, R, Python, MATLAB).
- Improve reliability, observability, and compliance posture.
- Enable secure access to multiple data sources with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).
- Provide an incremental migration path from legacy workflows (e.g., FAME syntax) while modernizing the stack.

Value for leadership:
- Standardization: one transformation catalog, consistent semantics.
- Efficiency: reusable pipelines, faster onboarding, lower run-time costs.
- Risk reduction: centralized controls, auditability, RBAC.
